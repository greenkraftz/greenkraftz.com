                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Please report any violations of the Terms that you become aware of by contacting us using the link at the bottom of the any page at AKZONEDU.COM at akzonedu@gmail.com. Any failure to act by AKZONE with respect to a breach by you or others does not waive our right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches by you or others. You understand and agree that, because damages are often difficult or impossible to quantify, if actual damages cannot be reasonably calculated then you will be liable to pay AKZONE the following as liquidated damages (and not a penalty):</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>a. If AKZONE establishes any limits on the frequency with which you may access the Service, or terminates your access to or use of the Service, you agree to pay AKZONE Indian Rupees ten thousand (INR 10,000) for (i) each message or information used from our site/other manuals (ii) for each day on which you access OLX in excess of such limits, whichever is higher.</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li><strong>b. If you aggregate, copy, display, mirror, reproduce, or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content (except for your own Content) in violation of these Terms without AKZONE express written permission, you agree to pay AKZONE 5 lakh Indian Rupees (INR 5,00,000) for each day on which you engage in such conduct</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">If none of the foregoing clauses (a) &ndash; (b) are applicable, you agree to pay AKZONE actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, AKZONE retains the right to seek equitable remedies, including without limitation, specific performance of any term contained in these Terms, or a preliminary or permanent injunction against the breach or threatened breach of any such term or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in these Terms, or any combination thereof, without the necessity of posting a bond.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Disclosures</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">On rare occasions, we may be required to disclose your personal information due to legal or regulatory requirements.
